2) false positive (FP) are ok
2) false negative (FN) never ok

YOUR CODING CHALLENGE:
1) Modify main.py to print a summary like a sample below
2) Implement methods `test` and `add` in forbiddenfilter.py
3) Don't starve and consistently eat at least 10 out of 11 vegan food ðŸ˜…

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Net result: 
- you ate 8 vegan food
- incorrectly rejected 3 vegan food
- correctly rejected 6 non vegan food
